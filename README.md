Welcome to my ft_printf

## The Project
In the ft_printf project at 42, we rewrite the standard C function printf to generate formatted output. Despite its brevity, this task is essential for understanding key C programming concepts like variable arguments and string formatting, making it a fundamental part of our development as programmers at 42.
